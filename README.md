# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three machine learning projects developed to solve real-world prediction and classification problems.

## 1. Flight Price Prediction
A machine learning model designed to predict flight prices based on various factors like route, time, and airline, utilizing algorithms like Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to achieve optimal accuracy.

## 2. Olympic Medal Prediction
A regression model that predicts the number of Olympic medals a country may win, based on historical data and athlete participation trends, providing insights through data correlation analysis.

## 3. Sonar Classification
A logistic regression model for classifying sonar signals as either rocks or mines, with a focus on signal processing and model evaluation to ensure high classification accuracy.
